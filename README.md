This project uses Tkinter to allow the user to store their password and email login details; it stores the name of the website and associated password and email on a text file. The user can either enter their own password, or use the password function to generate an automated password. Once the user has added their details, a popup appears to ask them to check that they are ok. Once the user confirms that they are correct, the data gets added to a text file. If the user leaves any field empty a popup will appear to remind them to fill in all fields.
